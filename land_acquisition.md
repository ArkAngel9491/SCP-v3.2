# Land Acquisition Strategy for SCP Pilot

## Goal
Secure land for the SCP pilot project in a way that is ethical, transparent, and cost-effective.

## Strategy Overview

1. **Public Land Partnerships**
   - Work with municipalities and local governments to repurpose unused or underutilized public land.
   - Offer mutual benefit through long-term economic revitalization and infrastructure investment.

2. **Land Bank Collaborations**
   - Acquire distressed or foreclosed properties through regional land banks.
   - Bundle properties to form cohesive development zones.

3. **Direct Purchase & Crowdfunded Buyouts**
   - Use a portion of the SCP pilot fund for direct land acquisition.
   - Launch public campaigns to crowdfund land buyouts, enhancing community ownership.

4. **Legacy Incentives for Private Donors**
   - Allow legacy-naming rights or project credits for large land donations.
   - Partner with mission-aligned philanthropists or trusts.

5. **Zoning and Legal Prep**
   - Work with legal teams and urban planners to pre-approve mixed-use development zones.
   - Ensure AI-managed zoning aligns with local codes and flexibility needs.

## Selection Criteria
