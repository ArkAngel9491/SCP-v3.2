## Why Now?
The world’s cracking:
- **Automation**: 20–30% of jobs at risk by 2030 (McKinsey).
- **Inequality**: Top 1% own >50% of wealth (Oxfam).
- **Trust**: 60%+ distrust institutions (Edelman 2024).

SCP v3.3 isn’t a revolution—it’s a system to rebuild trust, reward effort, and share dignity. We expect to fail fast and learn faster.

## What’s New in v3.3
This version upgrades SCP based on direct feedback, stress-tests, and community critiques:

- **Ethics Engine**: AI-vetted leadership based on behavior, not popularity  
- **Rotational Governance**: Short-term, no-campaign service cycles  
- **Refined Veto Protocol**: Rare, slow, and peer-audited—like a fire alarm  
- **System Failure Protocols**: What to do when trust, councils, or AI break down  
- **Equity vs. Efficiency Framework**: Inclusion-first decision design with conflict resolution  
- **Clarified AI Role**: AI advises. Humans always decide.

## Equity vs. Efficiency Framework
- **Adaptive Tracks**: Disabled and neurodiverse citizens matched by ability, not force  
- **Microvoice Mechanism**: Minority groups can flag exclusive policies  
- **Inclusion Mediation Panels**:
  - 1/3 marginalized
  - 1/3 technical
  - 1/3 random citizens
- **AI simulates both inclusive and efficient paths**; humans vote
- **Hard Rule**: If speed harms dignity, **we slow down**
- **Open Challenge**: Propose new inclusion logic for AI

## System Failure Protocols
**If the system fails, SCP adapts instead of collapsing.**

- **AI Outage** → fallback to citizen governance panel  
- **Council Collapse** → emergency jury reseats leaders  
- **Mass Trust Collapse** → public "Crisis Reflection Phase" + optional Reset Vote  
- **AI cannot restart without peer-reviewed safety check**  
- **All failures are livestreamed, logged, and open for audit**  
- **Open Challenge**: Build public-facing disaster dashboards
