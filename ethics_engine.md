# SCP v3.3 – Ethics Engine & Governance Vetting

## Overview

The Ethics Engine is not a judge. It’s a filter. It flags behavioral patterns, trust breakdowns, and bias risks for human review.

## Core Functions

- **Behavioral Flagging**: Scans trust networks for manipulation or abusive patterns.
- **Peer Vetting**: Elevates leaders based on anonymized endorsement, not popularity.
- **Rotation Enforcement**: Limits power duration (e.g. 4-month max terms).
- **Microvoice Input**: Gives underrepresented groups early influence in conflict decisions.

## Oversight Layers

- **Citizen Jury Audits**: Randomly selected review boards can override any AI recommendation.
- **Transparency Logs**: Every AI action logged, human-readable, and public.
- **Red Teaming**: Routine adversarial audits of AI decision weights.

## Tech Stack

- Open-source AI (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- On-chain voting receipts (optional)
- Public dashboards + livestream failover
