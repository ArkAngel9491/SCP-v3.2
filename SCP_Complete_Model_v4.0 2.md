## 1. Introduction
The Social Coordination Prototype (SCP) is a post-scarcity governance model built for resilience, contribution, and human flourishing. Designed for both Earth and Mars deployment, it provides a full-stack civic OS coordinated by AI, rooted in voluntary participation and real-time feedback.

## 2. Core Philosophy
SCP operates on the principle of **contribution over control**. It’s founded on:
- Trust, not coercion.
- Transparency, not opacity.
- Coordination, not competition.

Citizens agree to a **Social Contribution Pact**: a set number of hours of meaningful contribution in exchange for guaranteed access to life’s essentials and shared infrastructure.

## 3. System Overview
At its core, SCP is a hybrid system combining:
- AI assistance (Agent v0.1)
- Community decision-making (via Microvoice and Veto systems)
- Trust tracking and cultural audits
- Secure, decentralized data storage
- Equity-driven role assignment and feedback loops
