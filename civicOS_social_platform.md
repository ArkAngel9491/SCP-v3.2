# CivicOS: A Social Platform for Governance Engagement

## Purpose
Create a social interface for SCP that fosters informed civic engagement, reduces apathy, and enables AI-assisted transparency and responsiveness.

## Key Features

1. **AI-Augmented Discussion Feed**
   - Posts and discussions are elevated not by popularity but by verified informational value.
   - AI flags misinformation, prompts deeper questions, and summarizes complex threads.

2. **Civic Verification Instead of Voting**
   - Replace "likes" with tools like:
     - **Verify**: Confirms informational accuracy
     - **Expand**: Adds supporting info or relevant context
     - **Echo**: Signals shared civic intent without mob dynamics

3. **Anonymous Ethics Panel + Trust Webs**
   - Reports are triaged by a rotating, anonymous ethics panel.
   - Trust webs determine post visibility by merit, not charisma or outrage.

4. **Crisis-Resilient Information Flow**
   - In a failure fatigue scenario, CivicOS maintains integrity by elevating clarity-first communication.
   - Promotes fatigue-resilient discourse and emergency briefings.

5. **Integration with SCP Governance**
   - Panel and citizen decisions, AI recommendations, and resource allocation are all viewable and explainable in real time.
   - Acts as a knowledge layer between the citizen and the governance engine.

## Open Challenge
How do we balance free speech, transparency, and algorithmic elevation in times of crisis or conflict? Fork or suggest.
