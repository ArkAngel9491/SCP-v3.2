## Why Now?
The world’s cracking:
- **Automation**: 20–30% of jobs at risk by 2030 (McKinsey).
- **Inequality**: Top 1% own >50% of wealth (Oxfam).
- **Trust**: 60%+ distrust institutions (Edelman 2024).

SCP v3.2 isn’t a revolution—it’s a system to rebuild trust, reward effort, and share dignity. We expect to fail fast and learn faster.

## Pilot Plan
- **Scale**: 100,000 people, urban hub
- **Duration**: 3 years
- **Candidates**: Helsinki, Seoul, Portland (high trust, tech-ready)
- **Structure**: Elected boards, livestreamed councils, daily data releases
- **Goal**: Prove dignity, contribution, and AI can scale
- **Open Challenge**: Suggest pilot cities or metrics

## Funding Sources
- 40% NGO/Foundation Grants
- 30% Elite Buy-In (legacy projects, naming rights)
- 30% Crowdfunding + Local Tax Experiments
- **Open Challenge**: Propose funding models or cost optimizations

## Budget Snapshot
- **Target**: $400M for 3-year pilot
- **Breakdown**:
  - $100M: Housing (subsidies, shared units)
  - $100M: Food & Health (basics + triage)
  - $100M: AI & Infrastructure (servers, audits)
  - $100M: Operations (boards, training, PR)
- **Contingency**: 10% ($40M) for shocks
- **Lean Plan**: Scalable to $200M for 50K people
- **Open Challenge**: Fork to refine costs

## Contribution Tracks
- **Full-time**: 12-17 years of labor/learning
- **Part-time**: Caregivers, students, elders
- **Hybrid**: Custom schedules for flexibility

**Participants Get**:
- Advanced housing, education, voting power
- Prestige projects, allocation influence

**Non-Participants Get**:
- Food, shelter, triage care, public education (“library access”)
- No coercion, no punishment, no exclusion

**Open Challenge**: Design new track models

## AI Governance & Accountability
- **Triple-Redundant AI Placement**: Transparent, bias-audited
- **Black Box Crisis Teams**: Fix system failures fast
- **Citizen Override Panels**: Elected councils with veto power
- **Audit Trails**: Public, human-readable records
- **Appeal Caps**: 2-3/person/year, publicly reviewed
- **Tech Foundations**:
  - AI: Open-source (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  - Audits: Blockchain/DLT for transparency
  - Hosting: Hybrid cloud (AWS, Azure)
  - Security: E2E encryption, public code reviews
- **Governance Resilience**:
  - Board Terms: 4-month max, $5K stipends
  - Automation: Routine audits via AI
  - Backups: 50% surplus panelists
- **Open Challenge**: Build mock placement algorithms or audit tools

## Elite Management
- **Wealth Conversion**: Legacy projects (e.g., named schools)
- **Hard Wealth Caps**: Transparent ceiling, seizure for saboteurs
- **Tax Dashboards**: Global visibility into contributions
- **Open Challenge**: Design incentive or enforcement systems

## Sister Region Mandates
Every urban pilot links to a rural region:
- **Shared Resources**: Taxes, AI, infrastructure
- **Mutual Mentorship**: Urban-rural upskilling
- **Cultural Flex**: Local councils adapt tracks/perks
- **Scorecards**: Public success metrics
- **Open Challenge**: Propose urban-rural models

## Failure Protocols
- **Live Metrics**: Participation (70% target), satisfaction (80%), cost ($4K/person/year)
- **Public Debriefing**: Town hall after Year 1
- **Referendum**: Year 3 vote to continue, pause, or reboot v4.0
- **Open Challenge**: Fork to refine KPIs

## Path to Scale
1. One pilot proves the model
2. Ten sistered cities refine it
3. Global open toolkit for remixing
- **Compatibility**: Pairs with UBI, co-ops, public health
- **Open Challenge**: Design SCP-UBI hybrids
