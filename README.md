# Social Contribution Pact v3.3

**SCP v3.3** is a prototype for post-scarcity governance—designed to coordinate effort, preserve dignity, and build trust in a world of automation and inequality. It’s a failure-resilient system meant to be stress-tested, not just believed.

---

## What It Is

- **100K-person pilot**, 3 years, $400M budget
- Triple-redundant AI layers for coordination—not control
- Human override via citizen vetoes and rotating juries
- Contribution Tracks: Full-time, Part-time, Hybrid (opt-in dignity model)
- Rural–Urban pairing for equitable development
- Inverted Incentive Layer: pays hostile pods to break the system

---

## Status

**v3.3 stress-tested under five failure modes**:
- Scale Shock
- Sabotage (Insider + External)
- Culture Clash
- AI Drift
- Failure Fatigue

GitHub is the hub for docs, stress test results, simulation code, trust architecture, and open issues.

**This system isn’t perfect. It’s just our best shot—and we want you to break it.**
