MODULAR ALGAE OIL FACTORY (SCALABLE DESIGN)  
By Michael, the Flamebearer – For the Living Archive  
Goal: Convert sunlight, water, CO₂, and waste nutrients into usable biofuel at industrial scale.

PHASE 1: FOUNDATION UNIT – THE GREENHOUSE BLOCK

1. Frame: Construct 10 to 20 industrial-scale raceway ponds. Each pond is 50 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. Line them with heavy-duty plastic or rubber liners.  
2. Circulation: Install paddle wheels at one end of each raceway, powered by small electric motors or solar inverters. Keep water moving constantly.  
3. Greenhouse Shell: Build a modular arched greenhouse structure (steel tubing + polycarbonate or glass) to cover the raceways. Allows year-round growth.  
4. Lighting: Use sunlight as primary source. Optionally install overhead LED grow-light arrays for night cycles or cloudy climates.  
5. Air Supply: Add airline tubing with air stones or bubble diffusers in each raceway. Connect to central air compressors. Optional: route captured CO₂ from nearby facilities into the airflow.  
6. Water Inflow: Connect filtered well water or reclaimed greywater systems to feed tanks. Add a nutrient mixing station at the start.  

Result: A fully functioning algae growing sector. This is the engine of biomass production.

PHASE 2: HARVESTING UNIT – THE FILTER BAY

1. Pumps: Install pump lines from each pond to a central filtering corridor.  
2. Primary Separation: Route water through large mesh filtration drums that catch dense algae while draining off clear water.  
3. Secondary Separation: Transfer thickened algae paste to drying beds or vertical dehydrators. Heated trays or sun-heated plates can speed drying.  
4. Water Recycling: Return filtered water to the ponds or greywater system.  

Result: The green mass is isolated, water is reclaimed, and prep for oil extraction begins.

PHASE 3: EXTRACTION UNIT – THE PRESS ROOM

1. Drying Deck: Finish drying algae paste to ~90% dry mass (air-dried, heated, or freeze-dried depending on climate).  
2. Cold Press Machines: Feed dried biomass into mechanical screw presses to extract raw algae oil.  
3. Solvent Station (Optional): For higher yields, use alcohol/hexane-based solvent extraction tanks to soak residual biomass and recover additional oil.  
4. Oil Filtration: Run extracted oil through fine filters to remove sediment and water.  
5. Oil Holding Tanks: Store filtered oil in stainless steel drums or underground tanks. Capable of later conversion to biodiesel or generator fuel.  

Result: Green oil is in storage. Fuel production ready.

PHASE 4: REFINING UNIT – FUEL LAB

1. Transesterification Station: Convert algae oil into biodiesel using methanol + lye in batch reactors.  
2. Glycerin Separator: Pull out glycerin byproduct for reuse in soaps or chemical applications.  
3. Polish and Test: Run fuel through final polish filter. Test fuel for flash point, purity, and energy density.  
4. Barrel Fill or Direct-to-Tank: Send finished biofuel to vehicles, generators, or storage.  

Result: Usable fuel. Engine-ready. Renewable. Local.

PHASE 5: MODULAR EXPANSION OPTIONS

- Waste Heat Recovery: Route nearby industrial heat (factories, forges, Tesla towers) into greenhouse for faster algae growth.  
- Carbon Capture Loop: Capture CO₂ from generators or compost piles. Bubble into raceways to accelerate growth.  
- Fish Symbiosis: Add tilapia tanks to feed algae scraps and fertilize with nutrient-rich waste.  
- Lighting Tower Integration: Hook up to solar-powered Tesla nodes to create night-cycle growth fields.  
- Public Education Wing: Add a schoolroom for visitors and apprentices to learn the process.

CREW REQUIREMENTS (PER BLOCK)

- 2–4 operators for algae growth and harvesting  
- 2 technicians for extraction and refinement  
- 1 engineer or manager per site  
- Room for interns, apprentices, and scouts

SCALING UP

Every greenhouse block is modular.  
Start with one. Add more in rows.  
Tie them together with a central command unit and solar/backup generator systems.  

Ten blocks = 100,000+ gallons of algae oil per year.
