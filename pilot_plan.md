# SCP Micro-Pilot Plan (v3.3)

## Goal

Prove that a post-scarcity model with AI-supported governance, citizen vetoes, and dignity-first economics can work at 1K scale before scaling to 100K+.

## Proposed Locations

- Youngstown, OH (US): Cheap land, post-industrial community, eager for revival.
- Reykjavik (Iceland): Small population, tech readiness, green infrastructure.

- $1M – Food, Health, Basic Services
- $1M – Operations, Oversight, Community Tools

## Timeline

- Q2 2025: Planning & partner scouting
- Q4 2025: Begin land work & prefab installation
- Q1 2026: First residents onboarded
- Q2–Q4 2026: Run full simulation + governance stress tests

## Participation Tracks

- 700 full participants (on-site)
- 300 digital/remote for oversight, simulation, and design reviews

## Metrics to Track

- Participation rate
- Trust score engagement
- AI alerts vs. citizen overrides
- Conflict resolution outcomes
