# How to Build a Cheap, Scalable Oil Refinery (Modular Forge Edition)

## 1. The Purpose of a Modular Refiner

Its job is simple:
Take crude bio-oil (from algae or pyrolysis)
→ Heat it to separate components
→ Collect usable fuels (diesel, kerosene, etc.)

---

## 2. Core Components of a Basic Modular Refiner

Each unit can be built with these parts:
- Crude oil input tank (metal barrel or drum)
- Fractional distillation column (vertical steel pipe w/ baffles or trays)
- Condensation coils (copper tubing or car radiators)
- Collection tanks (steel drums or HDPE containers)
- Insulation shell (ceramic wool or brick enclosure)
- Heat source (propane burner, wood fire, or electric coil)

---

## 3. Step-by-Step: Building the First Module

### Step 1 – Input and Heating Chamber
- Use a thick steel drum or high-temp boiler tank
- Feed crude oil into it from a filter line
- Add temp gauge (goal: ~150°C to 350°C range)
- Heat it with propane or biomass fire

### Step 2 – Distillation Column
- Mount a vertical steel pipe (3–6 ft) above the boiler
- Weld in shelves (trays) or insert stainless scrub pads to separate vapor by temp
- Each height level pulls different fractions (lighter vapors rise)

### Step 3 – Condensation Line
- Connect copper tubing from the top of the column
- Run tubing through cold water bath (bucket, coiled radiator, etc.)
- Condense vapors back into liquid fuel

### Step 4 – Collection Tanks
- Place jugs or barrels at outlet points
- Label them:
  - Light oils (gasoline)
  - Medium oils (diesel)
  - Heavy oils (lubricants)

## 4. How to Scale It

- Start with 1 unit (refines 5–10 gallons/day)
- Build 5+ in parallel for a small community
- Create prefab kits for rural towns—metal + tubing + burner + manual
- Use shared heat sources and combine waste heat into algae tanks

Each town could run a co-op refinery fed by trash forges and algae ponds.
Simple. Effective. Community-run.

## 5. Safety & Upgrades

- Add pressure relief valves to input chamber
- Use firebrick to insulate the burn zone
- Upgrade to electric heaters + sensors for automated control
- Capture leftover gases (syngas) to power the forge itself

---

## 6. Output & Impact

With just one modular plant:
- 1 barrel of oil/day = ~42 gallons
- Split into ~19 gallons diesel, 4 gasoline, rest heavy fuel/oil
- 100 refineries = 4,200 gallons/day

## Summary: Why It Works

- Cheap to build
- Locally sourced materials
- Teachable to tradesmen
- Scalable in zones
- Can run on its own output (self-sustaining)
