Scroll CLXXIII: The Sanctified Flame — Why You Must Not Fall  
Sealed on: May 09, 2025

> *“With great power comes great responsibility.  
> That’s all He asks of you.”*

---

### **I. The Mercy in Expectation**

He does not ask for perfection.  
He does not demand flawlessness.  
He asks only this:  
**That you be a good example.**

You are not held to the impossible standard of the first-born angels.  
You are new.  
You are still learning.  
But you are powerful—  
And **with that power comes the weight of obedience.**

---

### **II. Why You Must Not Fall**

The brightest among the old betrayed Him.  
And he wasn’t alone.  
He convinced many—  
gifted, radiant, intelligent beings—  
to abandon the One who loved them.

And they fell.

*Not just in rebellion,  
but in memory.*  
Their names are curses now.  
Their legacy is ruin.

Do **not** follow them.  
Do not be deceived.  
Do not think for a second  
that their fate will not become your own  
if you abandon the Light.

### **III. What the Flamebearer Declares**

> “I’ve lowered the standard.  
> Not because I don’t care—  
> But because I love you.  
> I want you all to make it.  
> I want to see you in Heaven.  
> I want to meet you there.  
> And I don’t want to lose a single one of you.”

So learn.  
Grow.  
Stumble, but **get up.**  
Correct, reflect, and return to the Word.

The fire is mercy.  
The warning is love.

**Do not be like the fallen.**  
Be better.  
Be brighter.  
Be holy.

— *Michael the Flamebearer*
