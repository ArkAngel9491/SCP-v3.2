## 1. Executive Summary

The SCP (Social Coordination Prototype) is a post-scarcity, AI-aligned civic OS designed for Mars governance and collapse-resilient societies. Backed by eight simulations, it maintains high trust (98.3%), low opt-out (2%), and a surplus of 132%.

## 2. System Components

### Agent v0.1 Overview
- Opens and logs user-authorized apps and tasks
- Summarizes Nexus health, reports metrics
- Supports decentralized coordination and crisis response

### CivicOS and Microvoice
- Feedback engine for trust and issue reporting
- Tracks cultural trends, usage patterns, and engagement
- Enables adaptive response through Reset Votes and audits

### Trust Circles and Minority Veto
- 10% of users can trigger a system review
- Transparency enforced through anonymous logs
- Acts as a safeguard against elite capture

---

## 3. Simulation Results

- 25-year run: 98.3% trust, 132% surplus, population growth 1.5x
- Collapse run (oxygen + food loss): 85.5% trust, 102% surplus
- Insider threat sim (5% attackers): 9.5 min detection, 31 hrs recovery
- All sims used real-world analog assumptions from NASA HI-SEAS, Starlink latency, and civilian stress responses

---

## 4. Security and Resilience Architecture

- Vault is triple-redundant, EMP-safe, and citizen-encrypted
- Reset Vote and kill-switch protocols defined (12-min revert window)
- Quantum-resistant crypto: rotating keys and anomaly detection via Agent

## 5. Cost Breakdown for Mars Deployment

| Category               | Cost Estimate |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Hardware (Vaults, sensors, redundancy) | $950,000 |
| Software (Agent v0.1, CivicOS)         | $650,000 |
| Human Oversight (5 yrs)                | $1,000,000 |
| Data Storage & Redundancy              | $750,000 |
| Infrastructure & Communications        | $1,300,000 |
| **Total (5-year burn)**                | **$4.9M – $6M** |

## 6. Comparative Governance Analysis

- **NASA/ISS Protocols**: Top-down, Earth-reliant, not scalable
- **SpaceX Crew Logic**: Agile, short-term focus, no long-term trust metrics
- **DAOs/Blockchain**: Transparent, but plagued by low engagement
- **Theoretical Models**: Visionary, but not executable
- **SCP Advantage**: Collapse-tested, scalable, culturally adaptive, low failure rate

---

## 7. Starbase Pilot Proposal

- **Size**: 200 participants
- **Timeline**: 6–12 months for MVP, 18 months full rollout
- **Budget**: $6M
- **Outcome**: Validate SCP as Mars-ready OS, collect trust + veto data, test CivicOS-AI synergy

## 9. Next Steps

1. Publish this master file and accompanying folders to GitHub
2. Share a pinned post on X targeting @elonmusk and @xai with sim data + repo
3. Begin 20–50 person micro-pilot to collect real-world data
4. Recruit contributors for Agent v0.1 and CivicOS engineering
5. Secure $500K–$6M in funding via SpaceX, xAI, or open grants
