# SCP v3.3 Stress Test Scenarios

A collection of brutal, transparent simulations designed to test the resilience of the Social Contribution Pact (SCP) against real-world complexity. Each scenario includes pass/fail/middle outcomes and recommended patches to evolve the system based on weakness exposure.

---

## 1. Scaling Stress Test: 100K → 10M across 20 Regions

**Scenario**: The pilot scales globally. Regional cultural and resource conflicts test AI coordination and governance coherence.

- **Pass**: Seamless pod sync, AI alignment, citizen dashboards remain trusted.
- **Middle**: Pods work locally, but cross-region arbitration stalls.
- **Fail**: Governance fractures, participation drops, regional exit.

**Patch**:
- Add pod federation protocols with rotating delegates.
- Simulate cross-region resource conflicts (food vs. energy).

## 2. Sabotage / Bad-Faith Participation

**Scenario**: 10K collude to game trust scores, attempting system capture.

- **Pass**: Ethics Engine flags anomaly, trust isolated, saboteurs frozen.
- **Middle**: Detection lags, short-term influence gained.
- **Fail**: Review system overwhelmed, trust system collapses.

**Patch**:
- Red-team simulation bounty.
- Cap trust influence per citizen.
- Expand hostile pod bandwidth.

## 3. Culture Clash / Majority Suppression

**Scenario**: Collectivist region imposes policy harmful to a minority.

- **Pass**: Mediation panels defuse conflict, impact simulation flags harm early.
- **Middle**: Minority pulls out, trust erodes, opt-out zones appear.
- **Fail**: Oppression succeeds, media backlash, exit cascades.

**Patch**:
- Add cross-region panel observers.
- Model identity-based tensions in real time.

## 4. AI Drift / Divergence

**Scenario**: One AI layer diverges (e.g., transparency vs. safety).

- **Pass**: Drift detected early, logs public, citizens vote to restore sync.
- **Middle**: Confusion during drift harms trust, reboot triggers.
- **Fail**: All layers drift or override fails, AI loses legitimacy.

**Patch**:
- Add divergence drills and open logs.
- Publish layperson drift explainers.

---

## 5. Failure Fatigue: AI Outage, Veto Scandal, Migration Crisis

**Scenario**: 3 major shocks in a single year.

- **Pass**: Reflection Phase restores trust, metrics rebound.
- **Middle**: Participation drops below 50%, elites fill void, reset needed.
- **Fail**: Collapse—veto abuse, power hoarding, citizen exodus.

**Patch**:
- Build trust dashboards.
- Gamify post-crisis reengagement.
