# SCP v3.3 Stress Test Summary

SCP v3.3 was designed not as a utopia, but as a prototype to be tested under real-world failure modes. Below is a summary of the five major stress scenarios used to test the system's resilience and adaptability.

---

### 1. Scale Shock

**Scenario**: SCP expands from 1K to 10M participants in 18 months. Can its systems scale without centralization or elite capture?

| Pass | Fail | Middle |
|------|------|--------|
| Local pod scaling + federated decision zones | Trust collapse due to lag and coordination failure | Mixed results—urban areas outperform rural links |

**Patch**: Introduced pod federation logic and cross-zone bridge councils to distribute load.

---

### 2. Sabotage (Insider + External)

**Scenario**: An insider corrupts an AI layer; external actors attempt to poison audit logs.

| Pass | Fail | Middle |
|------|------|--------|
| Triple-redundant AI layers isolate corrupt node | Log chain spoofed; delayed detection triggers systemic panic | Insider caught, but trust score drops 15% for 90 days |

**Patch**: Cryptographic signing, hostile review pods, rollback protocol with livestreamed remediation.

---

### 3. Culture Clash

**Scenario**: A conservative rural hub and progressive urban hub enter conflict over contribution track norms.

| Pass | Fail | Middle |
|------|------|--------|
| Localized autonomy and shared veto structure prevent escalation | Veto gridlock paralyzes system and splinters networks | Soft power imbalance sparks exodus from one zone |

**Patch**: Cultural escrow arbitration system (shared rotating third party mediators).

---

### 4. AI Drift

**Scenario**: One AI layer begins recommending policies inconsistent with SCP’s ethics charter (e.g., eugenics bias from poisoned data).

| Pass | Fail | Middle |
|------|------|--------|
| Drift isolated by log mismatch; auto-quarantined | No detection; layer infects others and overrides jury system | Public notices drift, trust drops 25%, triggers hard reboot |

**Patch**: Added daily drift audit, hostile pod oversight, AI “truth budget” limiters.

---

### 5. Failure Fatigue

**Scenario**: After repeated failures, citizens stop participating in vetoes, juries, or audits.

| Pass | Fail | Middle |
|------|------|--------|
| Engagement stays above 50% with dignity rewards and emotional supports | Veto system collapses; bad actors gain unchecked influence | Participation dips to 30%, recovers after leadership reshuffle |

**Patch**: Cultural revitalization councils + shorter duty windows, stress audits, mandatory rest cycles.

---

**Conclusion**: SCP isn’t failure-proof—but it breaks soft and recovers fast. These tests don’t prove it’s ready—they prove it can learn.
